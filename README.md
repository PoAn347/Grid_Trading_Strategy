Using Grid Trading on Bitcoin
Introduction to Bitcoin Grid Trading Strategy

In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency trading, where market volatility and price fluctuations are the norm, traders and investors are constantly seeking innovative ways to navigate this dynamic landscape. 
One such strategy that has gained popularity in recent years is the Bitcoin grid trading strategy. 
This approach harnesses the power of automated trading and intelligent price level management to capitalize on Bitcoin's price movements within a defined range. 
Unlike traditional buy-and-hold approaches, grid trading operates within a structured framework, leveraging the concept of price grids to capture profits in both bullish and bearish markets. 
In this project, I delve into the fundamentals of Bitcoin grid trading, exploring its core principles, mechanics, and potential benefits. 
By understanding this strategy's mechanics, traders can effectively manage risk and potentially achieve consistent gains in the world of digital asset trading. 

This project is a Python-based exploration of a grid trading strategy specifically designed for Bitcoin. 
By utilizing Monte Carlo simulations, we establish upper and lower bounds, while carefully analyzing historical price jumps to determine the optimal grid lines.
